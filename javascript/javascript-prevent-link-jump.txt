You need to add preventDefault() to your click handler. This will stop the
browser executing it's own link handler, and will only run the code you
specify.

HTML:

    <a href="#" id="myID">Myquestion</a>

JavaScript:

    $("#myID").click(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
                // Do your stuff
    });

The most semantic and meaningful approach to this problem would be to handle
the onclick event from within JavaScript. Ideally this file would be best to
be stored in a seperate file, however, including a in-line script within your
problem file would suffice. Here's how i'd recommended approaching this
problem if your already using a JavaScript library like jQuery.

Assign an ID
Include an id attribute to your anchor so it's able to be selected using
jQuery:

<a href="#anchor" id="mylink" title="Title Here">Link Text</a>

Bind click event
From within your JavaScript file / in-line script include the following:

    $('#mylink').click(function(event) {

        // This will prevent the default action of the anchor
        event.preventDefault();

        // Failing the above, you could use this, however the above is
        // recommended
        return false;

    });

The method above is explained in full using the jQuery API websites:
