How many numbers between 1 and 10. Whether we should include 1 and 10?

Need to know ........when the question is to find how many numbers between 1
and 10 whether we should include 1 and 10 or no?

=============

8

----------

No, typically when they say how many numbers are between 1 and 10 we don't
include the "endpoints". So, the answer would be 8, assuming you mean how many
INTEGERS are between 1 and 10.

------------

1 and 10 are NOT b.e.t.w.e.e.n 1 and 10, so there are 8 numbers only for
answering your question.

I'd say do 2-8 XD
