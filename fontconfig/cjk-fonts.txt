# CJK fonts

My preference for fallback CJK fonts is new fonts > Source Han fonts > other new fonts > WenQuanYi fonts > Arphic fonts.

Most of the CJK fonts are still in active development. They will be better and better.

## Overview

Overview of CJK fonts of sans-serif for Simplified Chinese now:

1) Swei Gothic CJK SC is the best at this time. Although it has an issue about leg-ectomy of Source Han Sans SC.
2) Source Han Sans SC has a line gap issue which resulting in too high font height.
3) Most of other Source Han Sans SC based fonts have character issues.
4) Most of other not Source Han Sans SC based CJK fonts of serif have only one font weight or not enough CJK characters.

## Source Han CJK fonts (Source Han Sans and Source Han Serif)

Advantages:

1) Source Han fonts have most font weights and most of the other fonts have very little font weights or only Regular.
2) Most of other not Source Han CJK fonts based fonts do not have enough CJK characters.

Disadvantages:

1) Source Han Sans SC and Source Han Serif SC have a line gap issue which resulting in too high font height.
