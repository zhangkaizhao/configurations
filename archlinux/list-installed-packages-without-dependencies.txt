QUERY OPTIONS

       -e, --explicit
           Restrict or filter output to packages explicitly installed. This
           option can be combined with -t to list top-level packages- those
           packages that were explicitly installed but are not required by any
           other package. (-Qet is equivalent to the pacman 2.9.X -Qe option.)

So... "pacman -Qe" is the correct answer

Fardin Shikhiyev, I'm an Arch Linux user for nearly a year.

To search for already installed packages:

    $ pacman -Qs string1 string2 ...

To display extensive information about a given package:

    $ pacman -Si package_name

For locally installed packages:

    $ pacman -Qi package_name

Passing two -i flags will also display the list of backup files and their modification states:

    $ pacman -Qii package_name

To retrieve a list of the files installed by a package:

    $ pacman -Ql package_name

For packages not installed, use pkgfile.
To verify the presence of the files installed by a package:

    $ pacman -Qk package_name

Passing the k flag twice will perform a more thorough check.
One can also query the database to know which package a file in the file system belongs to:

    $ pacman -Qo /path/to/file_name

To list all packages no longer required as dependencies (orphans):

    $ pacman -Qdt

To list all packages explicitly installed and not required as dependencies:

    $ pacman -Qet

Visit Arch Wiki (the best distro wiki ever in my opinion) for more information about using Pacman.
