A {% csrf_token %} was used in a template, but the context did not provide the value. This is usually caused by not using RequestContext. warnings.warn("A {% csrf_token %} was used in a template, but the context did not provide the value. This is usually caused by not using RequestContext.")

render() is the same as a call to render_to_response() with a context_instance argument that forces the use of a RequestContext.
