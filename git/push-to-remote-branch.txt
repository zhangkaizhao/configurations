========
git push origin master:fix78 pushes the local master to a remote branch called fix78. You wanted to push the local branch fix78, which has the same syntax but without the master:

You can fix it by doing git push origin :fix78 to delete the remote branch and then git push origin fix78 to push your local branch to the remote repo.

========
The push command has the form of

    git push remote_name source_ref:destination_ref

All you need to do to correct your error is

    git push origin +fix78:fix78

The plus indicates that you don't care about that branch potentially losing history as the previous push was an error.

Alternate syntax is

    git push -f origin fix78

if you omit the destination, it's implied that it's the same name. If tracking is set up to a particular branch on the remote it will go to that one. Deleting branches has 2 syntaxes, the old:

    git push -f origin :fix78

and

    git push --delete origin fix78

The first is read as "push nothing into fix78" which deletes it.

One trick is that if you specify . as the remote name, it implies the current repo as the remote. This is useful for updating a local branch without having to check it out:

    git push . origin/master:master

will update master without having to checkout master.

Hope this helps
