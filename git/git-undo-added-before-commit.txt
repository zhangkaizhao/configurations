git reset <file>

which will remove it from the current index (the "about to be committed"
area) without changing anything else. Note that git reset <file> is short
for git reset HEAD <file>.

You can use git reset without any file name to undo all due changes.
This can come handy when there are too many files to be listed one by
one.
