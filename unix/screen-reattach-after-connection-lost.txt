 This will display a list of your current screen sessions. For instance, if you had one attached and one dead screen, you would see:

 There are screens on:
         25542.pts-28.hostname     (Dead ???)
         1636.pts-21.hostname      (Attached)
 Remove dead screens with 'screen -wipe'.
 2 Sockets in /tmp/screens/S-username.

To detach an attached screen, enter:

  screen -D

If you have more than one attached screen, you can specify a particular screen to detach. For example, to detach the screen in the above example, you would enter:

  screen -D 1636.pts-21.hostname

Once you've done this, you can resume the screen by entering the screen -r command.

(In the above example, the dead screen isn't causing problems, but you should probably enter the screen -wipe command to get rid of it.)
