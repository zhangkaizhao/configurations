Be sure to turn off all it's phone-home settings in the settings panel:

* disable Auto Sign-In
* set default search engine to DuckDuckGo (or anything except Google—lots of additional telemetry gets turned on by default when Google is the default search engine)
* disable "prediction service to help complete searches and URLs"
* disable "prediction service to load pages more quickly"
* disable "web service to help resolve navigation errors"
* disable "Safe Browsing"
* disable "improve Safe Browsing"
* disable "Do Not Track" header—it really just makes it easier to fingerprint you.
* block third-party cookies
* disable "offer to translate pages"
* disable "show notifications when new printers are detected"
* disable "continue running background apps when Chromium is closed"

Also, set the following in chrome://flags:

* Smooth Scrolling: (personal preference)
* UI Layout for the browser's top chrome: set to "Normal" to get the classic Chromium look back
* Identity consistency between browser and cookie jar: set to "Disabled" to keep Google from hijacking any Google login to sign you into Chrome
* SafeSearch URLs reporting: disabled

It should go without saying, but don't sign in to Chrome.

How to implement scrollable tab bar in Chrome like in Firefox?

https://superuser.com/a/1603546


I waited it from 2008 and this feature is finally here!

* For now it works only in latest version of **Chrome Canary**.
* Load chrome://settings/help to check the version and if updates are available. The feature is available in version 88.0.4284.0.
* List item chrome://flags/#scrollable-tabstrip in the browser's address bar.
* Set the Scrollable TabStrip experiment to Enabled using the menu on its right. Click on relaunch to restart the browser.

date: 2023-02-03
version: 108.
value: Enabled - tabs don't shrink
